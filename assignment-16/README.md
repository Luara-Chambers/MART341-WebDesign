#Assignment Final

## Luara Chambers

I learn a lot about web development this semester. Almost everything I ever knew about web development came from this class and my other creative coding class this semester.

The same goes for web design as I had not done any real web design that stuck with me before this class and any that I had I have forgotten unfortunately.

Overall I did not have many challenges this Final assignment, as I was able to go back through the materials and resources to figure out how to fix my Navigation bar and I was able to work hard to finish the rest. I choose to change my last assignment sight a lot, and make my final assignment somewhat of a gift to my family at the same time, by creating them a website for their kennel business. I did a complete workup from the ground up, and the only real thing I struggle with was trying to fill out content we did not have information for yet. Overall I had a great time with this class.
