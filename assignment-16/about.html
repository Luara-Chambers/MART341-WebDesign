        We are a small family run business, which started in 2014. We are a family of four who takes great pride in caring for and raising the puppies that we sell, and the care of the dogs that we breed. We are located in Montana, and our focus is on providing stellar quality hunting dogs who also will be known for their faithful companionship.
