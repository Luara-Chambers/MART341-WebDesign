You are not able to have more then one of each element head, or body on a page at a time when using html. The head contains Metadata, and other information such as the viewport, title, link, and style. Whereas the body contains the main part of the site, it is where the text, and images appear on the site, and can be marked up with structural, and semantic markup.

Structural markup focuses mainly on the structure of the site or document. It is including the h1 through h6 tags for headings , break tags, paragraph tags, ordered lists tags and unordered lists tags.

Semantic markup however, focuses more on placing emphases on the style or semantics of a site or document. This is done using the blockquote tags, cite tags, script tags, etc.

Overall this week I did not struggle that much with challenges, however I did have great success with creating my site with one of my favorite recipes of all time, Egyptian Milk Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Cake. It was very fun to create the site, and I had many new things I learned that helped me to make the site look much nicer then in the paste. I was especially thrilled when I got the subscript and superscript text to work for making fractions. In the end I am very excited to continue to make even more professional websites.
