I have come across many forms during my years browsing the web, and the majority of the time they serve the purpose of collecting information that will be processed and used for feedback and improving products, the site, or the company that is collecting the information. I have also seen forms that are used when signing up for services that a site or company may offer through their websites.

Examples of text input range from inputs such as passwords, names, and birth years, these are mainly used for gathering information that the user has to manually input. Examples of selection input are those such as radio buttons, check boxes, and dropdown menus. These are best used when a user has several options they need to choose from, and you are trying to get information from them on what option they like or desire most. Finally button input is mostly used when using upload, submit, or image buttons, and those are mostly used when it is time for a user to submit their information and they need a way for the page to know it is time to send/ load the information to be sent.

This week I had some trouble with getting my code to do what I wanted it to do. It turned out I had several hard to spot errors, and it took me almost an hour to finally spot the missing error. However once I got the error gone, and the program to work the way I wanted it to, it was smooth sailing from there, and I had great success as my page grew and slowly came to life.
