There are several types of selector types. The first is the universal selector type. This one is best used when trying to change styles of everything on a page at once. Next there is the Element selector type which is best used for selecting all elements of a specific type at once. Then there is the Class selectors which is great when wanting to select and assign various classes to different groups of parts of a function. Finally there is the ID selectors which are best when assigning different IDs and attributes to individual elements.

The color palette I choose was that of purple, pink, yellow, and orange. The reason I choose these colors was because I thought they best represented the neon nights of the wild 1980s. Overall I felt they best fit the scene and were vibrant enough to represent the time period.

This week I had very few challenges, and mostly many successes when it came to coding my website. In the end the only real big challenge I had came from having to rewrite my code because I had several spelling errors at one point and I had to go back and fix it. Overall a really good week.
