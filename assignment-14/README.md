#Assignment 14

My imaginary client was that of Big Blue Skys Kennels. They described their needs to me as needing a clean and welcoming site, that showcased their kennels, dogs, services, contact page, and information about the owners. They would also benefit from having extra links to and information about the AKC organization, tips about raising puppies, and more additional breed information.

I believe it is important to consider a mobile-first design because you are able to have an easier time scaling upwards from a smaller device then downwards from a larger device when it comes to trying to fit everything on a screen.

I had one major difficulty in this assignment and that was with trying to get my navigation bar at the top of the screen to stop from collapsing in on itself, and blocking the screen when it was shrunk down to a smaller screen size. I am unsure exactly what is going on with it that is keeping it from shrinking size instead. Other then that I feel I had a great success this assignment.
