# Assignment 11

## Luara Chambers

There are three main types of Fonts. These are System Fonts which are Fonts that are already installed on your device, Web Fonts which are the custom Fonts that are on various servers, and Web Safe Fonts that are fonts that can almost always be counted on to be available on both Windows and Mac.

It is always important to have a fallback font, because then when a site's font fails to load it won't be as jarring to the users visually, and you can then have the page have a few back up fonts to load from first.

Overall this week I had some struggles with fully understanding the assignment, however I believe that in the end, I was able to figure it out and finish the assignment.
