# Assignment 9

## Luara Chambers

Almost everything I have learned in this class has been new to me when it comes to HTML. I believe the biggest obstacle for me was probably getting used to typing out everything, and having the programs take me so literally where if I made a single typo or did not type a sentence or string of text a certain way then the whole program would not work.

I am very excited to learn more about how to style my HTML pages in the next section, however I am also a bit anxious because I am hoping that I have been doing everything correctly, and not learning bad habits that will come back to give me grief later on when I code in the future.

Overall I have had many challenges when trying to learn to code, especially as previously stated when it comes to spelling errors or typos, however I felt great accomplishment this week, when I made what felt like my first non-guided webpage, where it was more of a choice what we got to do, and how to design it. In the end I really enjoyed the freedom, and felt I did a good job with my current knowledge.
